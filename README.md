# Bike Sharing in NYC
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The goal of the project was to analyse usage of citi bikes in New York City. I retrieved the data for the most popular month – August 2019. Once retrieved, data needed to be transformed for consistency of anlysis. Utilized Tableau to create visualisations from transformed/loaded data. Once analysis were completed, created stories for the potential investors who would like to replicate NYC model in their small town.

## Results:
The deep analysis and results were eye-operers for the investors. Following images summarize my findings:

The chart revealed that the most rentals are 5-10 minutes long.

Male renters are most frequent renters yet few female renters rent for up to 60 minutes. Unknown customers are mostly short-term customers, they rent bikes for longer time than regular subscribers.

It’s easy to see that majority of rentals are done at 8am - 9am and 5pm – 6pm, before and after office hours. Most of the rentals are 5-10 minutes long, now we can assume that people use bikes to get to work and back home.

This analyses proves, while female and male customers have the same pattern and take bikes to commute back and forth to work or school, short-term customers tend to rent bikes during weekends and they make longer trips.

The similar heatmap with only weekdays helped to discover that the best day for bike maintenance is Wednesday. Male riders are active all week and weekend compare to female riders.

Manhattan is more popular than in others locations, likely more tourists visits and rent bikes. Also, starting and ending location are almost similar. Manual relocation of bikes is not required, shortage from demand unlikely.

## Summary:
Citi bike has steady customer base, 90% are regular subscribers, utilized bikes daily during peak hours of working days. Bike maintenace should be scheduled during slow times, early morning or off-peak days like Wednesdays

Male riders are the top revenue generators, users of rental bikes in NYC. Usage base loyalty program will retain this group of users and not moving to alternate commuting system like subway, city bus.

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
